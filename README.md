# Mnist_Prediction
# ðŸ§  Handwritten Digit Recognition using ANN & CNN
Developed a digit classification model using the MNIST dataset containing 70,000 handwritten digits (0â€“9).
Implemented both Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for prediction.
Compared model performances and achieved high accuracy with CNN due to its spatial feature extraction capabilities.
# ðŸ“Š The project showcases deep learning techniques for image classification using TensorFlow/Keras.
